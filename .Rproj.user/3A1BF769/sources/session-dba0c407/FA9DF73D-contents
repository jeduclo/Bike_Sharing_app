# Bike Sharing Data Analysis Shiny App

## Introduction
This repository contains a Shiny application designed to explore and analyze bike sharing data. The app offers an interactive platform for visualizing various aspects of bike usage, including trends, weather impact, and predictive modeling.

## Features
### Trend Exploration
Insights into seasonal, yearly, and hourly bike rental trends, including an analysis of holidays vs regular days and a 20-day moving average visualization.

### Statistical Exploration
Detailed statistical analysis featuring average and standard deviation calculations for bike usage per month, season, and hour. Includes boxplots and correlation analyses.

### Usage Patterns Exploration
Examination of bike rental patterns by user type, including weekly and seasonal variations. Additional visualizations for the proportion of rentals by user type and hourly usage patterns by weather conditions.

### Weather Impact Exploration
Analysis of how different weather conditions affect bike rentals with interactive plots.

### Hypothesis Testing
Investigates several hypotheses such as the impact of clear vs adverse weather, holidays vs non-holidays, and yearly differences on bike rentals.

### Predictive Modeling
Advanced modeling techniques, including GAM, ARIMA, and Prophet models, for forecasting bike rental trends.

## Installation


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
